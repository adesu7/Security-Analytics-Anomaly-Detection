Supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection of botnet data and generating adverserial samples for botnet data

The following report covers an implementation of unsupervised machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and gradient descent-based methods to generate adversarial examples against supervised learning models. The machine learning techniques were applied on network traffic (NetFlow) datasets, the datasets contain botnet traffic and normal traffic.
